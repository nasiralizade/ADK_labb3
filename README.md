# ADK Lab 3 - Bipartite Matching

This project implements solutions for bipartite matching problems using max flow algorithms. The project is divided into three parts:

## Project Structure

- [del1/](del1/) - Basic bipartite graph implementation
  - Uses `Biprep` class for graph processing
  - Handles I/O for bipartite graph and flow calculations

- [del2/](del2/) - Graph file processing
  - Contains test file handling
  - Implementation for graph input/output

- [del3/](del3/) - Advanced flow implementation
  - Enhanced `Biprep` class with max flow calculations
  - Complete matching solution implementation

## Building and Running

Each part can be built using the provided Makefiles:

```sh
cd del1
make
